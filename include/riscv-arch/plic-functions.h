     * @details
     * Sometime after a target receives an interrupt notification, it
     * might decide to service the interrupt. The target sends an
     * interrupt claim message to the PLIC core, which will usually
     * be implemented as a non-idempotent memory-mapped I/O control
     * register read. On receiving a claim message, the PLIC core will
     * atomically determine the ID of the highest-priority pending
     * interrupt for the target and then clear down the corresponding
     * source's IP bit. The PLIC core will then return the ID to the
     * target. The PLIC core will return an ID of zero, if there were
     * no pending interrupts for the target when the claim was serviced.
     *
     * After the highest-priority pending interrupt is claimed by a
     * target and the corresponding IP bit is cleared, other
     * lower-priority pending interrupts might then become visible
     * to the target, and so the PLIC EIP bit might not be cleared
     * after a claim. The interrupt handler can check the local
     * `meip/seip/ueip` bits before exiting the handler, to allow
     * more efficient service of other interrupts without first
     * restoring the interrupted context and taking another interrupt
     * trap.
     *
     * It is always legal for a hart to perform a claim even if the EIP
     * is not set. In particular, a hart could set the threshold value
     * to maximum to disable interrupt notifications and instead poll
     * for active interrupts using periodic claim requests, though a
     * simpler approach to implement polling would be to clear the
     * external interrupt enable in the corresponding `xie` register
     * for privilege mode `x`.
